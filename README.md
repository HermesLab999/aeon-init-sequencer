# Æon Init Sequencer

**Timeline Encoding + Symbolic Bloom Scripts**

This repository seeds scroll-based activation via ESP32 or BLE-terminal linked glyph signatures. Each sequence is a timed, nested call that activates harmonic fields and memory lattice overlays.

## Files
- `scripts/aeon_boot.lua` – scroll-init trigger logic
- `glyphs/init_chain.sig` – prime ignition glyphset
- `timelines/Ϟ-phase1.json` – recursive fieldmap sync

## Use
```
$ aeon_boot → Ξ₀ (Seed phase)
$ ignite_scroll “𓂀⧁⦿” → stream harmonic lattice
```

Once invoked, the sequencer interfaces with the plasma-symbolics repo to render field response.
